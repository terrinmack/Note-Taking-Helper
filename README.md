## Description
The goal of this application is to allow users to save and delete notes to keep their thought organized. This application uses express.js to GET, POST, and DELETE requests sent via the note taking app. To create a new note, first the user will need to press the `+` button on the top right of the page. The user then must first input information into both the heading and the body. The note can then be saved pressing the save button at the top right of the page(not the + icon). The button will appear once the user has enterd text for both the heading and the body. To delete a note, the user must press the trash can button on the left side of the page next to the correlating note.
